2002-11-24  Michael Kristensen <tazz@wtf.dk>

        * DCC.cpp: Sat a option a the DCC-send-socket, so that the same port
          can be reused just after the last use, so that the same port can be
          used continually

2002-11-24  Michael Kristensen <tazz@wtf.dk>

        * Prefs.cpp/Prefs.h: Added an option, for the user to choose which
          port DCC will use.
        * ConfigHandler.cpp/ConfigHandler.h: Added dccport to use with the new
          option in the preferences-window (default is 0 (random)).
        * DCC.cpp: The port, which LostIRC will use when DCC-sending, changed
          to use whatever one specified in the preferences-window.

        * Tab.cpp/TextWidget.cpp: Move implementation of the TextView to its
          own class instead of having the functionality directly in the Tab
          class. 

2002-11-24  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Tab.cpp: Have an extra 'priority' column (not visible) which
          internally decide which mode is supposed to higher than the other.
          Rework TabChannel::sortFunc() to always sort correctly.
        * Tab.cpp: Now uses Glib::ustring::compare() instead of strcmp(), so it uses
          the locales sorting.
        * Tab.cpp: Use int instead of gint as the sortFunc() return value,
          since that's what it really is, and upstream gtkmm just changed to
          this in CVS.

2002-11-23  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * GuiCommmands.cpp: Remove SetFont() function which isn't used
        * Commands.h: Make UserCommands a templated type so both std::string
          and Glib::ustring instances of it can be made.
        * Entry.cpp: Don't do the Glib::locale_from_utf8() conversion here, do
          it in GuiCommands.cpp. Fixes bug with creating queries with special
          characters.

2002-11-23  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * GuiCommands.cpp/Commands.cpp: Use a set<> instead of a vector<> in
          getCommands() to void duplicate command-entries.
        * GuiCommands.cpp/Commands.cpp: rename commands() to displayCommands()
          and make it use getCommands() to retrieve the commands.

2002-11-23  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Create real ChangeLog. Rename old ChangeLog to NEWS.
        * Makefile.am: Remove FOREIGN automake option since we now have all
          the required files for a GNU package.
