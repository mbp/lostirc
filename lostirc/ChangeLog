LostIRC (x.x.x)
  * There is a now a seperator between the main text window and the nick list
    which can be dragged to make the nick list smaller/bigger.
  * Fix a segfault which appeared with bouncers/servers sending malformed PART
    lines (they sent the channel _after_ the colon).

LostIRC (0.2.0)
  * Ported to gtkmm2, now depends on sigc++ 1.2 and gtkmm2.
    Noteable features with gtkmm2:
      * UTF-8 support
      * Improved fonts, e.g. anti aliased fonts when 'GDK_USE_XFT' is set
        (in bash, try `export GDK_USE_XFT=1`)
      * Cleaner and more attractive default interface
      * Double-buffering in widgets which prevents flickering

  * There is now a limit of 500 lines in the text windows - this can be
    specified using preferences. This makes sure the client doesn't use a huge
    amount of RAM.
  * /CLEAR and /CLEARALL is implemented to clear all text from the current
    window and all windows.
  * The font selection dialog is no longer opened using ALT+F, it is now

    now updated faster.
  * When exiting preferences, focus is now giving to the input box.
  * When going /AWAY, the title bar of the window wasn't updated until you
    switched to a new tab. Fixed.
  * A KDE menu entry (lostirc.desktop) is now installed by default in the same
    way as a GNOME menu entry has always been default. It can be disabled by
    using ./configure --disable-gnome and --disable-kde 
  * There is now an /EXIT command which can be used to send a quit-message to
    all connected servers and quit the client.
  * The nick-list no longer mentions "0 users" when a channel has parted, but
    "Not on channel"
  * There is now an "Limited highlighting" feature which can be used if you
    don't want to mark tabs red on joins/parts etc. but only on talk in a
    channel.
  * Colors used by text-window are no longer hard-coded into the code, they
    are now read from ~/.lostirc/colors.conf and can be changed by hand.
  * The client registered the name with a space in front of it, fixed.
  * When a topic was received for a channel the user was currently not on -
    the client aborted, fixed.
  * Unexpected behaviour when joining channels with different prefixes than #,
    fixed.
  * When using a bouncer and being on multiple channels, channel names like
    '#u~#foo' appeared - the nick-list were never filled on these channels,
    fixed.
  * The position of the window is now remembered.
  * URLs are now underlined.

  * KILL messages are now being parsed correctly (for those of you who get
    killed often..)
  * When a channel was parted with /PART, or the user was disconnected, a
    rejoin to the channel would make the nick-list reuse nicks from the

    fixed.

    client at all. Fixed.
