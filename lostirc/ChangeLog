        * GuiCommands.cpp/Commands.cpp: Use a set<> instead of a vector<> in
          getCommands() to void duplicate command-entries.
        * GuiCommands.cpp/Commands.cpp: rename commands() to displayCommands()
          and make it use getCommands() to retrieve the commands.

        * Create real ChangeLog. Rename old ChangeLog to NEWS.
        * Makefile.am: Remove FOREIGN automake option since we now have all
          the required files for a GNU package.
