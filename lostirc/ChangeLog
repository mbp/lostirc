        * Release 0.2.2

2002-11-28  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Prefs.cpp/Tab.cpp: Use stock icons instead of just text buttons.

2002-11-27  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * MainNotebook.cpp: Save cursor position, and unselect any selected
          text when switching tab.

2002-11-27  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * MainWindow.cpp: Change CTRL-c to CTRL-w.

2002-11-27  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * DCC.cpp: Don't call onReadData when we can send data, only when data
          is incoming.

2002-11-27  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * Parser.cpp: When the channel isn't found after the :, use the
          parameter before that.

2002-11-27  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * NickList.cpp/NickList.h: Seperate NickList code into its own class.
        * Tab.cpp/Tab.h: Remove TabChannel and TabQuery inheriting from Tab.
          Instead we identify the class with a bool member. Enabling us to
          remove or add the nicklist dynamically.

2002-11-25  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Move utf8-fallback code into its own function: convert_to_utf8().
          Replace all Glib::locale_to_utf8() calls with convert_to_utf8(),
          this should hopefully fix problems for people.

2002-11-25  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * There was no real good reason for the label to be created manually.
          No longer part of the Tab class, but access through the notebook
          widget using the new method MainNotebook::getLabel().

2002-11-25  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * ServerConnection.h: Make copy ctr and operator= private to avoid
          copying/pass-by-value.

2002-11-25  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * FrontEnd.h/MainWindow.h: Add connected() method.
        * ServerConnection.cpp/Parser.cpp: Call connected() when host is
          resolved and when we receive the first line from the server.
        * MainWindow.cpp: update the statusbar when we get connected, and when
          a nick changed.

2002-11-24  Michael Kristensen  <tazz@wtf.dk>

        * DCC.cpp: Sat a option a the DCC-send-socket, so that the same port
          can be reused just after the last use, so that the same port can be
          used continually

2002-11-24  Michael Kristensen  <tazz@wtf.dk>

        * Prefs.cpp/Prefs.h: Added an option, for the user to choose which
          port DCC will use.
        * ConfigHandler.cpp/ConfigHandler.h: Added dccport to use with the new
          option in the preferences-window (default is 0 (random)).
        * DCC.cpp: The port, which LostIRC will use when DCC-sending, changed
          to use whatever one specified in the preferences-window.

2002-11-24  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Tab.cpp/TextWidget.cpp: Move implementation of the TextView to its
          own class instead of having the functionality directly in the Tab
          class. 

2002-11-24  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Tab.cpp: Have an extra 'priority' column (not visible) which
          internally decide which mode is supposed to higher than the other.
          Rework TabChannel::sortFunc() to always sort correctly.
        * Tab.cpp: Now uses Glib::ustring::compare() instead of strcmp(), so it uses
          the locales sorting.
        * Tab.cpp: Use int instead of gint as the sortFunc() return value,
          since that's what it really is, and upstream gtkmm just changed to
          this in CVS.

2002-11-23  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * GuiCommmands.cpp: Remove SetFont() function which isn't used
        * Commands.h: Make UserCommands a templated type so both std::string
          and Glib::ustring instances of it can be made.
        * Entry.cpp: Don't do the Glib::locale_from_utf8() conversion here, do
          it in GuiCommands.cpp. Fixes bug with creating queries with special
          characters.

2002-11-23  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>
        
        * GuiCommands.cpp/Commands.cpp: Use a set<> instead of a vector<> in
          getCommands() to void duplicate command-entries.
        * GuiCommands.cpp/Commands.cpp: rename commands() to displayCommands()
          and make it use getCommands() to retrieve the commands.

2002-11-23  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

        * Create real ChangeLog. Rename old ChangeLog to NEWS.
        * Makefile.am: Remove FOREIGN automake option since we now have all
          the required files for a GNU package.
