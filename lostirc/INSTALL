INSTALLATION
------------

In order to compile LostIRC, you need have at least these things installed:

 * A C++ compiler, like g++
 * libgtkmm-dev (development files for gtkmm)
 * libsigc++-dev (development files for lib sigc++)
 * libglib1.2-dev (development files for glib 1.2)

For CVS versions, you need to create the configure script with autogen.sh.

Then execute these commands:
  
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ su
   $ make install
   $ exit
   $ lostirc

LostIRC is developed mainly with g++ 2.95.4 in mind - g++ 3 is not guranteed
to work. Especially if your gtkmm is compiled with g++ 2.95.4, and you're
trying to compile LostIRC with g++ 3, it simply won't work.
