README - LostIRC
----------------

LostIRC is a simple, yet very useful IRC client. It has features such as
tab-autocompletion, multiple server support, automatic joining of
servers/channels and DCC sending which should cover the needs of most
people. Another goal that the application has in mind, is 100% keyboard
controlability. It was written using the gtkmm GUI library.

LostIRC is licensed under the GPL. See included COPYING file.

INSTALLATION
------------

See included INSTALL file.

HELP
----

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to write me an e-mail.
If you're a C++ programmer and have any suggestions/patches for the code,
then that would be highly appreciated as well.
