README - LostIRC
--

LostIRC is an IRC client written to be simple and lightweight, it's supposed
to be a 100% keyboard controlled application. At least these are the goals
for the first stable version.

This version of LostIRC is an extreme pre version, a lot of things don't
work as expected, not all IRC features has been implemented yet, and it may
chrash now and then, so use with caution.
