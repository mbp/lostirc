README - LostIRC
----------------

LostIRC is an IRC client written to be simple and lightweight, it's supposed
to be a 100% keyboard controlled application. At least these are the goals
for the first stable version.

This version of LostIRC is an extreme pre version, a lot of things don't
work as expected, not all IRC features has been implemented yet, and it may
chrash now and then, so use with caution.

LostIRC is licensed under the GPL.

INSTALLATION
