README - LostIRC
----------------

LostIRC is an IRC client written to be simple and lightweight, it's supposed
to be a 100% keyboard controlled application. At least these are the goals
for the first stable version.

This version of LostIRC is a pre stable version, a lot of things don't work
as expected, not all IRC features has been implemented yet, and it may
chrash now and then, so use with caution.

LostIRC is licensed under the GPL. See included COPYING file.

INSTALLATION
------------

See included INSTALL file.

HELP
----

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to write me an e-mail.
If you're a C++ programmer and have any suggestions/patches for my code,
then that would be highly appreciated as well.
