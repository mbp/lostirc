README - LostIRC
----------------

LostIRC is a simple, yet very useful IRC client. It has features such as
tab-autocompletion, multiple server support, automatic joining of
servers/channels, logging and DCC sending which should cover the needs of
most people. Another goal that the application has in mind, is 100% keyboard
controlability. It was written using the gtkmm GUI library.

LostIRC is licensed under the GPL. See included COPYING file.

If it has your interest, there's an IRC channel for LostIRC where you can
get help/support or just a small chat on irc.freenode.net, #lostirc.
You can also subscribe to LostIRC mailing lists:
* lostirc-users <Lostirc-users@lists.sourceforge.net>: for any 
help/support with LostIRC usage.
* lostirc-devel <lostirc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>: for development 
informations/contribution

INSTALLATION

HELP

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to write me an e-mail.
If you're a C++ programmer and have any suggestions/patches for the code,
then that would be highly appreciated as well.
