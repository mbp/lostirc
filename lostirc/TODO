 * joining/parting/quitting
 * when a op gets voice, his status is lost
 * does op-status work properly?
 * write away reason in "you are away"
 * when away/unaway - title isn't updated until switch tab
 * ability to choose which nick-completion character to use
 * implement /help, /help shortcuts and /help commands
 * shortcut to change the font
