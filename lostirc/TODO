CRITICAL: 
---------
  * Implement DCC CHAT

NICE-TO-HAVE:
------------
  * Implement /help for all commands.
  * ipv6 support
  * When window has lost its focus, then highlight the front tab too.
  * /BAN and /EXEC command.
  * Virtual functions for Commands, to be overriden. Much more OO-like.

  * Some way to seperate tabs from each other, so they are server sorted.
  * Recognise URLs (and make them clickable?)

WIN32:
  * Doesn't fork() when using gethostbyname(), it should.

RANDOM BUGS:
------------
  * When text is in the input box, and you switch from one tab to another,
    going back to the tab with text in the input box, will make the text
    get selected, thus making it harder to append text to the already
    written text.

  * Color-parsing might be slow, since it inserts one character at the time.
    Need to look into optimizing it.

  * Check whether there are more bugs with implicit character set conversion
    with operator << and operator >>

  * Wrapping of text in the text widget is done character wise, it would
    be nice if it could be done word-wise. But when using WRAP_WORD, a bug
    in GTK+ causes the window to be resized when the new text is inserted.

    This can be solved when gtkmm 2.4 gets released, which has WRAP_WORD_CHAR.

  * This has to be removed from 'configure' at release time, or else the
    configure script fails on Red Hat/Mandrake:
    +extern "C" void exit(int); (:g/extern "C" void exit/d)

    (is still still the issue with 8.0/9.0?)

  * Should we check for EAGAIN on send()? It seems to always suceeed anyway.

DCC:
---
  * DCC port ranges.
  * Ability to cancel a DCC send.
  * DCCs should use their own events instead of just CLIENTMSG.
  * DCC objects should timeout when no response has been given
  * Show to the user which ip is being sent

BOOKMARK suggestion from Jim Winstead:
-------------------------------------
 i'd love some sort of 'bookmark' feature that would make it easy to jump
 back to the point where i last left a channel. so if i'm chatting away
 in one channel and conversation is going on in another, i can latter
 come back to that channel, jump to where i left it, and then quickly
 catch up on what i missed.

 My comments: When coming back to a channel, use CTRL-b to scroll to the
 point where one left it.
