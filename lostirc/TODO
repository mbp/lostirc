CRITICAL: 
---------
  * Implement DCC CHAT

NICE-TO-HAVE:
------------
  * Implement /help for all commands.
  * ipv6 support
  * When window has lost its focus, then highlight the front tab too.
  * /BAN and /EXEC command.
  * Virtual functions for Commands, to be overriden. Much more OO-like.

  * Some way to seperate tabs from each other, so they are server sorted.
  * Recognise URLs (and make them clickable?)
  * Add support for choosing which encoding to use. Now if a user has a
    UTF-8 locale, he will also send his text in UTF-8, causing most other
    locales (and Windows, mIRC) to fail reading the string.

RANDOM BUGS:
------------
  * Color-parsing might be slow, since it inserts one character at the time.
    Need to look into optimizing it.

  * This has to be removed from 'configure' at release time, or else the
    configure script fails on Red Hat/Mandrake:
    +extern "C" void exit(int); (:g/extern "C" void exit/d)

    (is still still the issue with 8.0/9.0?)

  * Should we check for EAGAIN on send()? It seems to always suceeed anyway.

DCC:
---
  * DCCs should use their own events instead of just CLIENTMSG.
  * DCC objects should timeout when no response has been given
  * Show to the user which ip is being sent

DESIGN:
-------
  * Comments from Martin Scholl about key_press_event system:
--
     maybe we should parametrize this a little bit
     via an arry of struct { <KEY>, <MOD>, <FUNC> }.
     doing so it would be very easy to implement new
     keystrokes. or better, we objectify this and
     in later revisions we implement an mechanism to
     register / customize key bindings via an configuration
     file.

BOOKMARK suggestion from Jim Winstead:
-------------------------------------
 i'd love some sort of 'bookmark' feature that would make it easy to jump
 back to the point where i last left a channel. so if i'm chatting away
 in one channel and conversation is going on in another, i can latter
 come back to that channel, jump to where i left it, and then quickly
 catch up on what i missed.

 My comments: When coming back to a channel, use CTRL-b to scroll to the
 point where one left it.
