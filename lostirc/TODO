CRITICAL: 
---------
  * Implement reading in ServerConnection better (more efficiently)
  * Implement DCC CHAT
  * After being disconnected, queries have a () around them.

NICE-TO-HAVE:
------------
  * Implement /help, /help shortcuts and /help commands
  * ipv6 support
  * When window has lost its focus, then highlight the front tab too.
  * /BAN command.
  * /EXEC
  * Virtual functions for Commands, to be overriden. Much more OO-like.

RANDOM BUGS:
------------
  * Should we check for EAGAIN on send()? It seems to always suceeed anyway.

  * This has to be removed from 'configure' at release time, or else the
    configure script fails on Red Hat/Mandrake:
    +extern "C" void exit(int); (:g/extern "C" void exit/d)

  * Background-colors (e.g. ^C15,5) isn't used/parsed.
  * Bold: ditto
  * Underline: ditto

GTKMM2 STUFF:
-------------
  * scrollbar has weird behaviour when resizing window
  * URLs clickable

DCC:
---
  * Add more events for DCCs (eg. don't use SERVMSG2 that much)
  * DCC objects should timeout when no response has been given
  * Possibility to define a different outgoing ip-address
  * Show to the user which ip is being sent
  * Possibility to track progress of DCCs

DESIGN:
-------
  * Comments from Martin Scholl about key_press_event system:
--
     maybe we should parametrize this a little bit
     via an arry of struct { <KEY>, <MOD>, <FUNC> }.
     doing so it would be very easy to implement new
     keystrokes. or better, we objectify this and
     in later revisions we implement an mechanism to
     register / customize key bindings via an configuration
     file.

BOOKMARK suggestion from Jim Winstead:
-------------------------------------
 i'd love some sort of 'bookmark' feature that would make it easy to jump
 back to the point where i last left a channel. so if i'm chatting away
 in one channel and conversation is going on in another, i can latter
 come back to that channel, jump to where i left it, and then quickly
 catch up on what i missed.
