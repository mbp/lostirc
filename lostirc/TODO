REALLY USEFUL FEATURES: 
-----------------------
  * Implement "colorschemes", so you don't have to use a black background.
  * Some way to seperate tabs from each other, so they are server sorted.

NICE-TO-HAVE:
------------
  * Implement /help for all commands.
  * ipv6 support
  * When window has lost its focus, then highlight the front tab too.
  * /BAN and /EXEC command.
  * Recognise URLs (and make them clickable?)

RANDOM BUGS:
------------
  * When text is in the input box, and you switch from one tab to another,
    going back to the tab with text in the input box, will make the text
    get selected, thus making it harder to append text to the already
    written text.

  * Color-parsing might be slow, since it inserts one character at the time.
    Need to look into optimizing it.

  * Wrapping of text in the text widget is done character wise, it would
    be nice if it could be done word-wise. But when using WRAP_WORD, a bug
    in GTK+ causes the window to be resized when the new text is inserted.

    This can be solved when gtkmm 2.4 gets released, which has WRAP_WORD_CHAR.

  * The window expands very wide when a lot of text is inserted into the
    statusbar. This doesn't happen when we use the Gtk::StatusBar widget,
    but unfortunately it doesn't support pango markup.

    The solution is to wait for gtkmm 2.4, which should support it.

  * Should we check for EAGAIN on send()? It seems to always succeed anyway.

DCC:
----
  * DCC port ranges.
  * DCC objects should timeout when no response has been given.
  * DCC CHAT.

WIN32 TODO:
-----------
  * Doesn't fork() when using gethostbyname(), it should.
