CRITICAL: 
---------
  * Implement reading in ServerConncetion better (more efficiently)
  * Implement DCC CHAT
  * Should have a limit on the text-buffer, not go on forever.
  * port to gtkmm2 when it's ready

NICE-TO-HAVE:
------------
  * half-op support
  * limited tab highlighting, don't mark a tab red when
    joining/parting/quitting
  * implement /help, /help shortcuts and /help commands
  * ipv6 support
  * note when window has lost focus; then highlight front-tab
  * /OP, /DEOP, /VOICE, /DEVOICE commands.

RANDOM BUGS:
------------
  * you can't see long nicks in nick-list, possibility to move the nick-list
    as a user
  * nicks overlaps status (@, + etc.) in nick-list.
  * strip all mIRC color-codes from ALL strings, don't show colors at all.
  * when away/unaway - title isn't updated until switch tab
  * on some systems, there is commas in the real name field (3 to be
    precise)
  * lostirc.desktop shouldn't be copied on non-GNOME systems.
  * lostirc.desktop should be distributed as KDE link as well.
  * check for EAGAIN on send()?
  * nick-list mentions "0 users" instead of "Not on channel" when a channel
    has been parted with /PART.

  * remove this from 'configure' at release time:
    +extern "C" void exit(int); (:g/extern "C" void exit/d)

DCC:
---
  * Add more events for DCCs (eg. don't use SERVMSG2 that much)
  * DCC objects should timeot when no response has been given
  * Possibility to define a different outgoing ip-address
  * Show to the user, which ip is being sent
  * Possibility to track progress of DCCs

DESIGN:
-------
  * Comments from Martin Scholl about key_press_event system:
--
     maybe we should parametrize this a little bit
     via an arry of struct { <KEY>, <MOD>, <FUNC> }.
     doing so it would be very easy to implement new
     keystrokes. or better, we objectify this and
     in later revisions we implement an mechanism to
     register / customize key bindings via an configuration
     file.

BOOKMARK suggestion from Jim Winstead:
-------------------------------------
 i'd love some sort of 'bookmark' feature that would make it easy to jump
 back to the point where i last left a channel. so if i'm chatting away
 in one channel and conversation is going on in another, i can latter
 come back to that channel, jump to where i left it, and then quickly
 catch up on what i missed.
